# Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) design
This project shows the circuit design and simulation of a two-stage and four-stage Voltage Controlled Oscillators required in high-speed and wide bandwidth applications. The work has been performed at a supply voltage of 1.8V on 180nm technology on Cadence Virtuoso tool.

# Schematic of 2-Stage VCO
The circuit is designed on 180nm technology on Cadence Virtuoso at supply voltage of 1.8V. The circuit uses NMOS varactors to obtain large tuning range for the control voltage. When the control voltage increases, the resistance of the PMOS and capacitances of NMOS increases and vice versa.

# Schematic of 4-Stage VCO

4-Stage VCO is designed with four delay stages using NMOS varactors and provides lower oscillation frequency as compared to the 2-Stage VCO due to increase in the number of delay stages.
